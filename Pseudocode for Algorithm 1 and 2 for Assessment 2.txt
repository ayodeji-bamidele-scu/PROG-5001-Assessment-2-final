Algorithm 1: Method to display students below a certain user-defined threshold

Function:
printStudentsBelowThreshold(students: List of Student objects)
    Print "Input the threshold for total marks: "
    threshold = Read user input as a double

    Print "Students with Total Marks Below " + threshold + ":"
    For each student in students
        If student's total mark is less than the threshold
            Print student's last name, first name, and student ID
            Print "Total Mark: " + student's total mark
            Print "Average Mark: " + student's average mark
        End If
    End For
End Function


Algorithm 2: Methods to find the top 5 students and bottom five students based on the total marks

Function printTopStudents(List<Student> students):
    Sort students in descending order by total marks
    
    Print "Top 5 students:"
    For i = 0 to 4:
        If i is less than the number of students in the list:
            Get student at index i from the sorted list
            Print student's last name, first name, and student ID
            Print "Total Mark:" followed by student's total mark
            Print "Average Mark:" followed by student's average mark
            Print a blank line
        Else:
            Break the loop since there are no more students to print

End Function

Function printBottomStudents(List<Student> students):
    Sort students in ascending order by total marks
    
    Print "Bottom 5 students:"
    For i = 0 to 4:
        If i is less than the number of students in the list:
            Get student at index i from the sorted list
            Print student's last name, first name, and student ID
            Print "Total Mark:" followed by student's total mark
            Print "Average Mark:" followed by student's average mark
            Print a blank line
        Else:
            Break the loop since there are no more students to print

End Function
